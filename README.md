# DataScience-and-Quant-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science and Quantitative Portfolio! This repository is a collection of projects, learning resources, and personal milestones as I work through various concepts in data science, machine learning, and quantitative analysis.

The goal of this repository is to document my journey in mastering these fields by building real-world projects, solving problems, and gaining hands-on experience with different techniques and tools.

# Overview
This repository showcases my growing knowledge and skills in Data Science and Quantitative Analysis. My journey includes topics such as:

# Data Preprocessing and Analysis
* Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised)
* Quantitative Finance and Algorithmic Trading
* Deep Learning
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Time Series Forecasting
* MLOps and Deployment

I actively contribute to my portfolio by adding new projects that align with industry standards and best practices, allowing me to expand and strengthen my understanding of AI, data science, and quantitative methodologies.

# Skills and Technologies
Throughout this journey, I have worked with various tools and technologies. Some of the main ones include:

* Programming Languages: Python, SQL, R, MATLAB
